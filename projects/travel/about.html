            &emsp; Since moving to the United States in 2016. Magdo has traveled to and from his home country, Brazil, paying high prices for his
            airline tickets. He spent almost 5 years coming up with a plan to start his own company to provide cheaper prices on airline tickets
            in the vast market.
            <br/><br/>
            &emsp; Magdo and his wife have 1 daughter and now live in Utah. They love to travel, explore new cities, and provide self-less service. Magdo
            worked as a Supervisor for Nature's Distribution, serving as the lead Supervisor for the company. He trained dozens of employees while preparing
            his future career of package airline ticketer.
            <br/><br/>
            &emsp; Despite the unfortunate price rises in the recent years, Magdo and his family now sell discounted airline prices that sell on a first-come
            first-server basis by email contact only! Magdo always says, "No matter your desired destination, your cheaper price is secured with us!"
            <br/><br/>
