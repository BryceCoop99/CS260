            <div class="review-title">Travel Destiny is overall good!</div>
            <div class="review-desc">Even if you've had your share of airline phone calls who are stubborn or hard to work with, Magdo and his family
            are much better than those guys. Instead, MAgdo will actually take the time to work with you to find a good ticket for cheaper than other
            available prices even if it ends up taking up a good chunk of his time.</div>

            <div class="review-desc">Travel Destiny wasn't something I thought I could work with until I heard about the prices. They are incredibly 
            cheaper!</div>

            future.</div>
