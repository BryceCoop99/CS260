          <div class="about-title">About Greg Cooper</div>
          <div class="about-desc">Greg has been photographing since he was 16 years old. At first, his photography skills were merely for hobbies.
          When he turned 22, friends and family reached out to him for photo shoots because of the talent that they saw in his pictures. For several
          decades now, Greg has been doing his best job helping those around him by taking pictures for family photoshoots, family gatherings, school
          dances, weddings, and his favorite, reptiles. He has a keen eye for photographing reptiles and making them look remarkably colorful in any
          setting.</div>
